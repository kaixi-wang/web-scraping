31,5.0 out of 5 stars,What to Expect.,2019-02-21,Verified Purchase,The case is too perfect if you are looking for protection and nothing else. I rate a 10 star our of 5 its that good.  It has literally baffled spigen.When it comes to the stand its almost non functional. There are few imperfection when it comes to the slot cuts. Its affects the beauty but It doesn't affect protection or functionality in anyway. I am not a heavy user so I am not sure how it can handle heat. The case definitely looks premium. I suggest you buy this case and never try to use the stand It would stay cool. Because if you break the stand its not going to look that great. It completely justified the price without the functionality of the stand. !,2 people found this helpful,R2Q9WOQZ2Y4M8T,,Charging-Airpods-Charger-Wireless-Station,B07VZ5TNCQ,5.0,B07VZ5TNCQ,2

48,3.0 out of 5 stars,Small Form Factor Charger for the Apple Watch,2019-09-09,Verified Purchase,I just started using it yesterday so only a day old review. The product has a very small factor and unlike the magnetic puck that comes standard with the watch this product connects straight to a USB port. I am using it to charge my Apple Watch 4 and it is working as expected. The watch charged to 100% in approximately an hour. Good device to keep while travelling or at your Office desk. The Watch can only be placed with the crown facing outwards due to the small form factor of the magnetic puck.Dropping one star from my earlier one as the charger works intermittently now.,One person found this helpful,R229ABW185TSY6,,AE-Accessories-Wireless-USB-Compatible,B0799LXN7K,3.0,B0799LXN7K,One
49,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get the plastic variant.,2019-05-06,Verified Purchase,"Regd the Black Plastic Variant.Disclosure - I received a coupon from the seller to try out the plastic variant after I was dissatisfied with the aluminium variant.This one looks quite good. the customisable felt pads are a nice touch. Have not faced issue with charging on this one.Plastic material feels firm and comes with an option to stick to the table.The below applies to the aluminium variant,The aluminium stand has odd proportions causing watches to have a small gap between bottom of watch and the bottom of the stand, (when connected to the charging cable) causing the watch to slowly drop from the magnetic charger.As a result I often find the watch disconnected after a day or so - with 10% charge left.EDIT: After a a month or so of use, I'm bumping it up to 3 stars. I've discovered that this works better with the Apple Watch charging cable that came with the watch - rather than the replacement cable (also from Apple). My theory is that the replacement cable is not magnetic enough and causes the watch to slip quite easily. The in-box cable takes a day or two to slip. To prevent the slipping problem completely, I've used a flat piece of wood (about 2 mm thick) over the silicone/rubber mat under the watch. This ensures that the watch doesn't drop too much and works to keep it charging.Would I recommend it over other stands - probably no. But considering the lack of accessories for the Apple Watch in India - I'd say this is better than nothing. I can work with it.(tested with Series 3, 42mm)",2 people found this helpful,R1RK000FMBMTRE,,Gelink-Compatible-Apple-Midnight-Silver,B07MW1RZDQ,5.0,B07MW1RZDQ,2

Compatible with my Galaxy S9 Plus3. Compact size and easy to carry aroundCons1. Slow charging as its a 5W charger. Go for higher W charger if you dont like slow charging. It takes almost a double time to charge my S9 Plus with this charger. But I am fine with it as higher W charger costs much more so I am looking mostly for a convenience here rather than fast charging speeds.Go for this if you are ok with slow charging.

Placed my iPhone XR (it has spigen cover) charging started and the led started blinking green. Within 30sec led became red. There was no metal there. After many trials it started charging.Problems:1. Even when the phone is fully charged led continually flashes green instead of steady green.2. It is never orange.3.

However when put this product to use for my Samsung galaxy S9, the charging rate was a little disappointing as it takes an average of 2 hours to charge your phone completely whereas the Samsung wireless charger was quite faster compared to this product.  I would definitely not recommend this is you are looking for a fast wireless charger. Also this heats up the device more than usually what a phone would get Heated up during a wireless charger.FYI : Do connect it to a fast charge adapter, recommended to use the brick provided by your phone manufacturer (If it comes along with the box as Samsung provides)",One person found this helpful,R21Q5FF240XZPV,,Belkin-Wireless-Charger-Samsung-Enabled,B00TPLUZMI,3.0,B00TPLUZMI,One

216,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good. Flawed design,2019-07-24,Verified Purchase,The distance between the inside of the top lid and the watch is zero which means the watch constantly touches the bottom of the top lid from inside. The hard top is also a slightly soft top so will not protect the watch if it falls  . Also there is no cutout outlet for usb cable so case has to be kept open while charging so your cable dangles over the zip while charging. Some similar watch cases on amazon USA have a port behind so u can keep the case closed while charging  . A better option in design is a Sena Apple Watch case which I eventually purchased after a lot of research on amazon USA  .

228,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive Charging Cable For Apple Devices!,2019-12-02,Verified Purchase,"As a tech person, I am invested in the Apple ecosystem. To ensure that I do not have to worry about charging each one of them separately, I had to look out for something that can charge multiple devices at once.That's why I got the Trajectory 3 in 1 Wireless Charging Cable.The length of the cable is 1 M, which I think is more than enough. The small size also means that I can carry it around without worrying about space constraints.Thinks that I liked- Multiple charging ports- It comes with wireless charging for Apple Series 1/2/3 watches. It is magnetic in nature- Good quality cable built using thick copper cable- Standard size- Works nicely when charging three devices at once.The charger also has proper protection mechanisms, including over-voltage protection, over current protection, and temperature protection.Things that I think can be improved- Pricing can be better- A carry case would have been a great addition to itIf you liked my review, then do click the helpful button.

The customer service responds quickly enough, this has an actual 1 year warranty. I'm very careful about using different chargers with my iPhone as I've seen the phone get a little warm when I don't use the official charger.I did some voltage measurements on the output ports, the quickcharge port gives 4.98V while the remaining ones are at 5.16V. I think this might be because there is a second voltage regulator for compliance on the quickcharge port. The USB spec allows 4.75-5.25V, I've seen that my iPhone charger gives about 5.05V while the samsung one puts out about 5.3V.Due to the better voltage regulation, do use the quickcharge port when using with the iPhone. Practically, I've observed that the phone remains cool when I use the quickcharge port or the official charger.The quickcharge port will only speed up charging if there is a compatible phone connected to it.

275,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get the plastic variant.,2019-05-06,Verified Purchase,"Regd the Black Plastic Variant.Disclosure - I received a coupon from the seller to try out the plastic variant after I was dissatisfied with the aluminium variant.This one looks quite good. the customisable felt pads are a nice touch. Have not faced issue with charging on this one.Plastic material feels firm and comes with an option to stick to the table.The below applies to the aluminium variant,The aluminium stand has odd proportions causing watches to have a small gap between bottom of watch and the bottom of the stand, (when connected to the charging cable) causing the watch to slowly drop from the magnetic charger.As a result I often find the watch disconnected after a day or so - with 10% charge left.EDIT: After a a month or so of use, I'm bumping it up to 3 stars. I've discovered that this works better with the Apple Watch charging cable that came with the watch - rather than the replacement cable (also from Apple). My theory is that the replacement cable is not magnetic enough and causes the watch to slip quite easily. The in-box cable takes a day or two to slip. To prevent the slipping problem completely, I've used a flat piece of wood (about 2 mm thick) over the silicone/rubber mat under the watch. This ensures that the watch doesn't drop too much and works to keep it charging.Would I recommend it over other stands - probably no. But considering the lack of accessories for the Apple Watch in India - I'd say this is better than nothing. I can work with it.(tested with Series 3, 42mm)",2 people found this helpful,R1RK000FMBMTRE,,Gelink-Docking-Organizer-Smartphones-Compatible,B07VZLWQRF,5.0,B07VZLWQRF,2

300,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Does what it claims to do, a FastCharging marvel.",2019-09-30,Verified Purchase,"Bought this Raegr Arc200 from the Amazon Sale (29Sep-3Oct) for Rs.999 and from the 1st looks of it, it felt really light weight yet a very good built quality (wont say sturdy but we are NOT to be playing frisbee with it). The charging pad does not flex or bend or makes any squeaky noises of any sort when pressed with normal force of the hand and is of the circular size of a coffee mug top i.e. approx. 3.5inch in total diameter. The Micro USB (USB B cable) provided is also of good thick quality and fits perfectly in the Charging Pad's socket without any loose fit. While the other (USB A) goes to the Adapter (which is NOT supplied with the product) hence I am using my original Samsung s10 adapter to connect this Pad via the Pad's supplied USB B (Micro USB) cable (black colour) and it provides Fast Charging to my Samsung s10 and takes the exact same time as with its own Adapter+USB C cable (wired charging). The Adapter needs to be fast charging capable to help charge the phone optimally and DOES NOT depend on the cable supplied in the box because i interchanged my Samsung Adapter with a OnePlus Adapter (which was also Warp Charge compliant) and the charging was NORMAL and NOT fastCharging for my s10. While the Device is charging, a green led ring glows indicating charging activity.Giving this 4 stars because the Company should've provided a fastCharging adapter as a Complete Package.Edit: posting an extended review of this product on the lines of:Wireless Fast-Charging(using Raegr ARC 200 pad)-vs-Wired Fast-Charging(using the mobile phone's supplied Adapter+cable)I own the Samsung Galaxy s10 device and have charged my s10 using the following adapters (with their observations):1.) Original Samsung s10 Adapter+USB C cable: message displayed on the mobile screen ""Fast Charging"" and charging time shown is 1-hr and 30-mins while charging the s10 having 10% battery left.2.) Original Google Nexus 6P Adapter+USB C cable: message displayed on the mobile screen ""Fast Charging"" and charging time shown is (again the same) 1-hr and 30-mins while charging the s10 having 10% battery left.3.) RAEGR ARC 200 (this product)+supplied microUSB cable+Original Samsung s10 Adapter: message displayed on the mobile screen ""Fast Charging wirelessly"" and charging time shown is 2-hr and 10-mins while charging the s10 having 10% battery left. This is +40mins extra when compared to Wired Fast-charging whihc is +44% extra time taken when charging my s10 wirelessly fastCharge versus wired fastCharge.This is NOT bad because Wireless (Fast) Charging pads -OR- Wireless (Fast) Charging power banks are slower and designed to be this way when compared to their wired (fast) charging counterparts.Kindly Note: No wireless fast chargers (pads or power banks) can compete or charge from 0% to 100% in the same time taken with respect to their wired connections even though both supply power at 10W or 7.5W or 5W respectively.Another thing to note: Is the generation of slight heat while charging wirelessly as compared to negligible heat while charging wired. But this is NOT a heat rating that would cause harm to your mobile device and/or battery inside, this is minimal than a normal heat but when comapred to a wired charging heat, it feels more but only slightly.This product is good and compactly built and offers a hands-free/cord free experience while using your mobile phone. Just place the phone and live hassle-free but it would be a problem for many of us who watch videos while the phone is charging with a cord as this pad only has a flat orientation/desk mode and NOT a tilt mode so that your phone can be kept at an angle while we watch movies lying down on bed.",10 people found this helpful,R2BY602F1SAUO1,,RAEGR-Qi-Certified-Wireless-Fire-Proof-RG10048,B07SQQJNSM,4.0,B07SQQJNSM,10
301,4.0 out of 5 stars,Descent wireless charger iPhone X,2019-07-27,Verified Purchase,"ARC 500 >This is one of the good wireless charger available right now. I am using this for my iPhone X.Light weight , compact and yes of course have capability to fast charger but you need to buy QC2.0/3.0 adapter separately for this as per seller. They say it supports 5W/7.5W/10W. Earlier separate chargers were there for 5W/10W but this came with multi capability. Price segment is good as competitor chargers for 7.5W are still expensive and cost more than 4000. But again this is made in china stuff so we can expect that price could have been a bit lower. Still you cannot complain as it comes with 2+1 yrs of warranty. So cheers and buy it without too much worry...Experience : I have used and tested with multiple adaptors for fast charging including oneplus’s dash charger but I don’t think it actually works. As iPhone X supports 7.5W, it could have been easily noticed even if it could have charged my iPhone in same time as standard 5W wired charger do that comes in the box with iPhone.

330,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Does what it claims to do, a FastCharging marvel.",2019-09-30,Verified Purchase,"Bought this Raegr Arc200 from the Amazon Sale (29Sep-3Oct) for Rs.999 and from the 1st looks of it, it felt really light weight yet a very good built quality (wont say sturdy but we are NOT to be playing frisbee with it). The charging pad does not flex or bend or makes any squeaky noises of any sort when pressed with normal force of the hand and is of the circular size of a coffee mug top i.e. approx. 3.5inch in total diameter. The Micro USB (USB B cable) provided is also of good thick quality and fits perfectly in the Charging Pad's socket without any loose fit. While the other (USB A) goes to the Adapter (which is NOT supplied with the product) hence I am using my original Samsung s10 adapter to connect this Pad via the Pad's supplied USB B (Micro USB) cable (black colour) and it provides Fast Charging to my Samsung s10 and takes the exact same time as with its own Adapter+USB C cable (wired charging). The Adapter needs to be fast charging capable to help charge the phone optimally and DOES NOT depend on the cable supplied in the box because i interchanged my Samsung Adapter with a OnePlus Adapter (which was also Warp Charge compliant) and the charging was NORMAL and NOT fastCharging for my s10. While the Device is charging, a green led ring glows indicating charging activity.Giving this 4 stars because the Company should've provided a fastCharging adapter as a Complete Package.Edit: posting an extended review of this product on the lines of:Wireless Fast-Charging(using Raegr ARC 200 pad)-vs-Wired Fast-Charging(using the mobile phone's supplied Adapter+cable)I own the Samsung Galaxy s10 device and have charged my s10 using the following adapters (with their observations):1.) Original Samsung s10 Adapter+USB C cable: message displayed on the mobile screen ""Fast Charging"" and charging time shown is 1-hr and 30-mins while charging the s10 having 10% battery left.2.) Original Google Nexus 6P Adapter+USB C cable: message displayed on the mobile screen ""Fast Charging"" and charging time shown is (again the same) 1-hr and 30-mins while charging the s10 having 10% battery left.3.) RAEGR ARC 200 (this product)+supplied microUSB cable+Original Samsung s10 Adapter: message displayed on the mobile screen ""Fast Charging wirelessly"" and charging time shown is 2-hr and 10-mins while charging the s10 having 10% battery left. This is +40mins extra when compared to Wired Fast-charging whihc is +44% extra time taken when charging my s10 wirelessly fastCharge versus wired fastCharge.This is NOT bad because Wireless (Fast) Charging pads -OR- Wireless (Fast) Charging power banks are slower and designed to be this way when compared to their wired (fast) charging counterparts.Kindly Note: No wireless fast chargers (pads or power banks) can compete or charge from 0% to 100% in the same time taken with respect to their wired connections even though both supply power at 10W or 7.5W or 5W respectively.Another thing to note: Is the generation of slight heat while charging wirelessly as compared to negligible heat while charging wired. But this is NOT a heat rating that would cause harm to your mobile device and/or battery inside, this is minimal than a normal heat but when comapred to a wired charging heat, it feels more but only slightly.This product is good and compactly built and offers a hands-free/cord free experience while using your mobile phone. Just place the phone and live hassle-free but it would be a problem for many of us who watch videos while the phone is charging with a cord as this pad only has a flat orientation/desk mode and NOT a tilt mode so that your phone can be kept at an angle while we watch movies lying down on bed.",10 people found this helpful,R2BY602F1SAUO1,,RAEGR-Qi-Certified-Charger-10W-Plus-Black-RG10049,B07V5N1WHT,4.0,B07V5N1WHT,10
331,4.0 out of 5 stars,Descent wireless charger iPhone X,2019-07-27,Verified Purchase,"ARC 500 >This is one of the good wireless charger available right now. I am using this for my iPhone X.Light weight , compact and yes of course have capability to fast charger but you need to buy QC2.0/3.0 adapter separately for this as per seller. They say it supports 5W/7.5W/10W. Earlier separate chargers were there for 5W/10W but this came with multi capability. Price segment is good as competitor chargers for 7.5W are still expensive and cost more than 4000. But again this is made in china stuff so we can expect that price could have been a bit lower. Still you cannot complain as it comes with 2+1 yrs of warranty. So cheers and buy it without too much worry...Experience : I have used and tested with multiple adaptors for fast charging including oneplus’s dash charger but I don’t think it actually works. As iPhone X supports 7.5W, it could have been easily noticed even if it could have charged my iPhone in same time as standard 5W wired charger do that comes in the box with iPhone.

It lights up in blue from both sides when its powered on. and once it recognises the device is incompatible it turns red. a great feature to know if the device doesn't support it or isn't charging from the pad. Has some weight to it which makes it look sturdy and long lasting and the cloth mat goes great with my google home mini as it had the same colour and compliments my desk. Price could be a bit lower, but it comes in sale often.

378,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely useless product,2018-11-01,Verified Purchase,"I have a Oneplus 5 smartphone and my work involves a lot of meetings. It was annoying to carry around my smartphone to be reminded of the meetings and that was my primary motivation to buy Gear S3, besides the other features it provided.When I researched about Gear S3, I found that it could connect to wifi independently and hence will not be dependent on the mobile phone. Alas! That was only for the models sold outside India. The India models can access data only via the smartphone bluetooth which means your mobility was restricted to 100 meters of your phone. That kind of sums up my entire frustration with the watch. This watch is smart only in the presence of a bluetooth enabled smartphone, else it's dumber than the imbeciles of Namaste England.In theory the watch claims to be doing a lot of things, from tracking your movements to notifying you of updates, to innumerable watch faces - but honestly all of them fall flat without the presence of your smartphone around.Add to it, the absolutely horrible and abhorrent documentation of Samsung or their community centers. The community centers are just echoes of wails from similarly frustrated customers who are unable to figure out what makes this costly hardware a smartwatch.Honestly, purchasing this would be an absolute waste of a money. Better buy a Fitbit or some other fitness band",116 people found this helpful,RWL411CHFF5EQ,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,1.0,B01N6OLO8U,116
379,4.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely top notch with some accuracy issues,2019-07-28,Verified Purchase,"I was looking to buy a smartwatch since last 2 years and went through a lot of research and youtube videos to finally purchase Samsung Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch. The below review is based on 10 days of extensive usage of the watch. I have divided this review into pros and cons so let's see them one by one. We will start with the Pros firstPROS1- Gear S3 frontier is probably the best-looking smartwatch in the market which gets tough competition from Fossil Q Marshall. The rugged metallic look and finish gives it an amazing look and is a treat for your wrist.2- The big 46 mm dial gives a clear vision of time and small detailings like heart rate, calories burnt, steps walked, etc in just a single dial.3- There is absolutely no lag in the watch. The responses are absolutely quick and the touch is very good.4- All thanks to the Tizen OS, there are hundreds of paid and free watch faces available in the galaxy store which gives a new look to your watch every day.5- The calling feature is the best feature and is very useful if you are riding a bike or running or jogging. You don't have to take out your phone every time to see who is calling. The speaker is sufficiently louder and you can easily take calls on your watch without any problems.6- Push notifications are absolutely accurate and give you a lot of options to choose from the apps installed on your phone. You can read and reply to WhatsApp messages, FB messenger and SMSs as well. Typing on the watch is quite difficult due to the obvious small screens.7- I don't use a Samsung phone and there are no connectivity issues with the watch whatsoever.8- The rotating bezel does the job exceptionally well and from now on, I can't imagine my next smartwatch without a rotating bezel.CONS1- I am pretty much disappointed with the accuracy of the watch. While the heart rates and calories are measured with sufficient accuracy, steps count is not accurate as it counts steps even when I ride a bike or drive a car.2- I very much miss the availability of Samsung Pay (NFC) in the watch as it is not available in Indian models. Hope Samsung brings it soon to India.3- Being a sportsman, I really miss the sports modes in the watch. There is no Badminton mode or Tennis mode in the watch which is present even in the cheaper fitness bands available in the market.4- I wish Samsung provided an extra metal strap with the watch as the watch looks stunning with a metal band which i had to purchase separately.5- The battery lasts for 2-3 days if you keep the watch switched off when not in use or else even lesser. It takes good 4-5 hours for the watch to get fully charged from 0-100% which is very long.6- While riding a bike, the Cycling mode gets automatically started which shows the lack of accuracy.If you are looking for a great smartwatch with many features, this is surely the one you must go with as Galaxy Watch is very costly as compared to Gear S3 with only a few additional features. I got this watch at 15,990 on Prime day and i am super happy with it. If you find this review useful, just mark it HELPFUL so that others may read and get the information too.",78 people found this helpful,RIOIT65FPK50S,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,4.0,B01N6OLO8U,78
380,3.0 out of 5 stars,Zero for water resistance and customer support!,2019-03-16,Verified Purchase,"Hello,I brought Samsung smart watch in January 2019(3 months back). Now I have an issue that the device is continuously rebooting. I took it to the service center and they found water presence inside the watch and said that it wont be covered under warranty. Also the total amount for repair is around 16K which is 80% of watch cost.I wore my watch in rain. It comes to me as a surprise that a watch which claims to be a sports watch that can be used in 1 m deep water for 30 min is showing problems in mild rain!! I would also like to know if Samsung is cheating its customers by showing wrong specifications. I searched for reviews for the watch and found that many of your customers had the same issue. None of them are acknowledged by your team.Giving reviews for the product is the least thing that I can do at the moment since Samsung is unable to help me out for this issue, so that the other customers are not mislead.I am planning to compliant in consumer court for the same. Could you please help me out on how I can escalate this matter, so that Samsung can improve their product?For a reputed company like Samsung, it is totally unacceptable to release a product without giving accurate specifications.",61 people found this helpful,R3FDVMZE571QIM,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,3.0,B01N6OLO8U,61
381,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good to have if you have extra money !!!,2019-02-11,Verified Purchase,"To be brief, I find it useless. But read on to find out why. I bought it because it looks incredible, physically. However: - When in standby mode, the screen degrades the quality and the faces look low res. - When used with iPhone, there are no good watch faces at all. Seriously.The only good watch face is one that comes stock that has 2 circles on the sides, one with the weather and one with sunrise/sunset time. I want a watch that does the following: Looks amazing and manly, shows the time at all times, shows the weather, shows steps, shows calories burned, displays notifications and the rest is optional. - It has an always on display but it only lasts 1 day with it on. - It now has a continuous heart rate, but if you have this feature on, it will die before you go to bed. - It has GPS tracking but it will die in less than a day with it on - It has sleep tracking but there will be no battery left to track your sleep, so you'll likely charge it at night. - It has no map app, no GPS directions, you can't use it to guide you around. - The cool spinning gear, gets rotated due to rubbing on clothes and that triggers the watch to wake up, distracting you and other people, wasting extra battery, etc.I emailed Samsung about it and they included an option to disable the gear from waking up the watch in the latest software. One feature that it does great is take phone calls from your wrist.The speaker is loud and clear, but who makes phone calls anymore? So I have used this feature less than 5 times in 1 year. Another feature that's great is being able to play music right off the watch on it's built in speaker. I love this ability but there don't seem many opportunities to use it as I'd rather use headphones on the go and a bluetooth speaker at home. And finally, it's just too big!A standard men watch is 42mm, this is 46mm and it's quite high too due to it's rotating bezel. While I've gotten used to it's size, my clothes haven't. Dress shirts will feel tight around your wrist with the watch on and your wrist will hurt when you wear a winter jacket that's tight around the wrists to keep you warm. Nowadays, it just sits in it's charger and I don't have much opportunity to use it.",47 people found this helpful,RGSBJMKKMLSDC,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,3.0,B01N6OLO8U,47

405,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get the plastic variant.,2019-05-06,Verified Purchase,"Regd the Black Plastic Variant.Disclosure - I received a coupon from the seller to try out the plastic variant after I was dissatisfied with the aluminium variant.This one looks quite good. the customisable felt pads are a nice touch. Have not faced issue with charging on this one.Plastic material feels firm and comes with an option to stick to the table.The below applies to the aluminium variant,The aluminium stand has odd proportions causing watches to have a small gap between bottom of watch and the bottom of the stand, (when connected to the charging cable) causing the watch to slowly drop from the magnetic charger.As a result I often find the watch disconnected after a day or so - with 10% charge left.EDIT: After a a month or so of use, I'm bumping it up to 3 stars. I've discovered that this works better with the Apple Watch charging cable that came with the watch - rather than the replacement cable (also from Apple). My theory is that the replacement cable is not magnetic enough and causes the watch to slip quite easily. The in-box cable takes a day or two to slip. To prevent the slipping problem completely, I've used a flat piece of wood (about 2 mm thick) over the silicone/rubber mat under the watch. This ensures that the watch doesn't drop too much and works to keep it charging.Would I recommend it over other stands - probably no. But considering the lack of accessories for the Apple Watch in India - I'd say this is better than nothing. I can work with it.(tested with Series 3, 42mm)",2 people found this helpful,R1RK000FMBMTRE,,Gelink-Apple-Watch-Stand-44mm,B07VXCSHZ3,5.0,B07VXCSHZ3,2

Based on my experience with this watch, below is my review of Mevofit ECHO B500 Ultra.😍 Good Stuffs👍🏻 Ruggerised build qualitygives what it claims👍🏻 Tracking is 90% acurate👍🏻 Looks cool and flashy too😕Bad Stuffs👎🏻 Whole screen is not touchscreen👎🏻 Sleep detection don't work most of the time👎🏻 Color display would be better🔴B.O.T'S QUICK VERDICT⭐Don’t misinterpret it as a smartwatch. It is basically a fitness tracker watch.⭐It has all the features you expect from a fitness band of this price segment but in form of a watch.⭐It can track steps, calories, blood pressure, heart rate, and sleep.●●FULL DETAILED REVIEW●●👉 DESIGN፨ It looks Stylish. The watch has a shockproof aluminium casing.፨ The front side has an OLED display to show time, date, battery, calories and other data.፨ The upper glass is scratch resistant and won’t get scratches easily from nails or anything else.፨ Just below the display, it has a touch sensitive button for checking steps, distance, calories, blood pressure, heart rate and sleep data one by one.፨ At the right side, it has a physical button that also does the same thing and additionally can be used to turn the watch ON or OFF.፨ You will have to press this button for 3 seconds for turning it ON or OFF.፨ At the back side, it has heart rate sensor, blood pressure sensor and charging port.👉 STRAP፨ It has skin Friendly TPU Medical Grade Strap. The strap is easy to Fix & Secure Buckle.፨ The watch looks really good in the hand. Build Quality is fine. I did a few minor drop tests and it didn’t get any issue.👉 WATER RESISTANCE፨ The most important thing you need to note that the watch is not complete water resistant. So, prevent water or sweat seepage.፨ This is the let down because it is a fitness watch and you will get sweat while performing fitness activities.👉 FITNESS FEATURES፨ This watch can track steps, distance, calories, blood pressure, heart rate, and sleep. These data can be checked on watch.፨ There is also a companion app for checking historical data and customize a few settings.፨ The app shows you historical data of everything it collects including steps, distance, calories, blood pressure, heart rate, and sleep.፨ although sleep doesn't get recorder everytime its a bit finicky፨ The blood pressure sensor is an addition that was not in any of the fitness band from the brand I tested in past.፨ This can be really helpful for those who have a blood pressure problem. They can use this to keep track of their blood pressure.👉 MEVOFIT APP፨ This watch also shows notifications. You can also control what app can send you notifications.፨ You can set reminders for different things. It also has a sedentary alerts option that keeps you notifying about moving.፨ It also has an anti-theft alert that notifies you when your phone goes out of range.፨ It can also be used as a remote shutter for your smartphone camera.፨ It consists of many in-app challenges to complete which give you credits to buy more stuffs from mevofitsleep tracker is a bit finicy.it works acording to its mood👉 BATTERY LIFE፨ It offers 7-10 days of battery backup depending on how much notifications you have enabled.፨ From normal charger(not samsung faste charger) it took around 1 hour to completly charge. Battery back up of the watch is good.🔴B.O.T'S FINAL VERDICT🔹Considering the price, I found this a good product as it performs well and delivers what it promises.🔹In a busy lifestyle, fitness tracker becomes a helpful device and this device tracks everything you may want.🔹The only let down is the lack of water resistance. So, you will have to be extra careful.🔴If you have any Doubt regarding this Review or this Product, then Feel Free to Contact me or Just ask me by commenting below.I Hope this Review was Helpful.Write reviews, help others, happy shopping.Thank You for Reading this Review.-●➽ʙʜᴀᴠᴇsʜ ʙ.ᴏ.ᴛ 🔥",48 people found this helpful,R3H1Q3B0XKB4KZ,,MevoFit-Ultra-Fitness-Activity-Pressure,B07KX43DPM,4.0,B07KX43DPM,48

445,4.0 out of 5 stars,Is it Worth to Buy in 2019 ? | Detailed Review after 1 Year of Usage |,2019-06-24,Verified Purchase,"NOTE :@ When you first connect this watch to smartphone via app, it will take approx. 20-25mins to Update the resources, so don't worry its normal.@ This watch has IP68 waterproof rating, but DO NOT take it for Swimming, as its NOT swimming certified and you may end up with a Dead watch.@ There's NO option to set the Time to 12 Hr format. You get few watch faces which are 12 Hr config. by default@ With practical use Battery lasts close to 20 Days only ( check below for Detailed battery Performance )Its more than 1 Year that I am using this watch. Till date I haven't faced any issue and this was my daily basher watch. Being impressed with the performance I decided to Buy this for my Dad from here. So based on my 1 Year of user experience following are the observations,●● If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review ●●# The Screen is sufficiently large to navigate via Touch gestures and has 2.5D curves at the end (Resembles Apple watch)# Always ON Screen with adjustable Brightness.# Charging is via Dock & Fast and gives battery backup of more than a 20 days.# Its very Light weight and compact.# The Strap is extremely comfortable and also easily replaceable.# Has Full Whatsapp, Instagram, Message, Call, etc Notification Alerts*.*There's NO option to respond.# Connects to both android and iOS, without any problem.# Has tons of Watch faces and 3rd party side-loading is also possible via app or directly via PC.# Watch interface is Clean and easy to use.# Has ACCURATE built-in GPS, Compass, Memory to store apps & Music, Continuous Heart Rate monitoring, Sleep Tracker.# Display is pale ( Low Resolutions ), since its Trans-reflective.# Can't use this while Swimming.# Plastic is prone to scratches, in long run.Full Detailed Review :---● DESIGN ●  -----------# It is quite Slim and 1.28"" display with 2.5D cuvred glass looks Classy.# It is extremely Light as well ( just 33 g with straps on ) and is one of the most comfortable watch I have.# It has Plastic housing with Matte finish, which looks great, but prone to wear in long run, if you use it daily.# It has 2 pin contact charging dock, which tends to corrode in long run and you need to clean them each time you charge.# Finally Quality of the strap is top notch and feels comfortable.* Now even after a year of usage, there are NO scratches on the main display, but the plastic housing surrounding has few scratches.* Charging pins have now slightly corroded, but that have not affected the charging performance.● DISPLAY ●  ------------# It sports 1.28"" Trans-reflective display which gives crystal clear output.# The display is Square and has bright Backlit (Adjustable).# Viewing angle are great and has better Contrast compared to Amazfit Pace.# Its very responsive and has Awesome readability specially in direct sunlight.# Colours aren't Vibrant enough, due to its Low Resolutions.# Watch faces are optimized to suit the low res. and provide best possible results.* Touch screen even now works as lucid as it was new.● FEATURES ●  --------------*It has 3 main options namely Notification menu, DND toggle & Main Menu ( Other Options, all in Right side ).# DND toggle is on the top and can be easily accessed with simple pull & click.# Notification menu is at the bottom and shows all the notification of the connected smartphone.* Almost all app's notifications can be viewed on it.* Call Notifications are pushed as well and you have option to Silence it or Reject it.* There's No option to respond back to Text notification.# Other Options are in Right side and has many apps namely Daily Activity Status, Exercise Mode, Weather Forecast, Alarm, Timer - (Stopwatch & Countdown), Compass and Settings.# You can also set the function of Physical Button of watch as per your need.# There's Find my phone also available in the watch.●● Sports Mode ●●  ==========There are 4 Modes in fitness App namely Run, Walk, Treadmill, Cycling, which are tacked using GPS and Heart rate sensor. I used Walk feature daily and I must say that its very accurate. The GPS works accurately measuring the distance and speed with maximum accuracy. Heart Rate sensor is very accurate and measures the heart rate continuously. All the stored data can be easily accessed from watch directly and can be Exported to phone or Mail.*It is Not equipped to be used while swimming, hence you won't find a Swimming mode in it. But it can take heavy rains and daily water splashes easily.●● Watch Faces  ●●  ==========There are many watch faces inbuilt and many more can be Downloaded. There's setting available in few watch faces for colour adjustment and other stuffs from 3rd Party apps or PC.●● Sleep Tracker  ●●  ===========As usual Xiaomi Sleep trackers are Spot on and more than 90% Accurate. Its automatically activated and senses ONLY Night sleep data.All the Data can be accessed from Watch itself or from Smartphone.It has also got Sedentary Reminder which reminds if you are sitting in one position for Longer period.● BATTERY PERFORMANCE ●  -------------------------------# It takes only 60 minutes to charge device from 0 - 100%.# With watch in Flight Mode, it can easily last more than 30 days.# With Bluetooth connected and moderate use, battery lasts for approx 20-24 days.# If Fitness app is used with GPS for about a hour or more, then battery lasts for 10-14 days with ease.* After 1 year of continuous daily usage, I am getting almost same battery backup as it was new.● CONS ●  -------# Contrast is low and at times looks very dull.# Updates are not very frequent.# Charging points have started corroding, but getting same performance as usual.# Finding a replacement strap which is affordable is pain.# Can't view the GPS track on the smartwatch itself. You will need the companion app for that.●●● VERDICT ●●●  -----------Its indeed a impressive Fitness smartwatch in current market. Has almost all the features one needs. GPS and HR monitoring is Precise and with battery life of over 20 days its just a charm. If you want to buy your first premium and accurate Fitness smartwatch and don't want to shell out more than 5k, then certainly Go for it.At the given Price and Features offered, I Highly Recommend this Watch.If you have any doubt regarding this watch, then feel free to comment below.Thank You for reading this review.",860 people found this helpful,R3GIR1ZGTIVGDT,,Amazfit-Huami-Screen-Smartwatch-A1608,B078YRTS86,4.0,B078YRTS86,860
446,5.0 out of 5 stars,Value for money plus amaze battery!!,2019-06-02,,"I wanted a health tracker to pair with an Android phone. I used the MI band 1 and then upgraded to MI band HRX edition. I was looking out to upgrade to a smart watch this time and didn't want to spend big. Came across this Huami Amazfit Bip, read many reviews and watched many video reviews on Youtube, and made up my mind to buy it.Pros-StylishLight weightReflective screenBattery life per chargeMI Fit app compatibilityCons-Music feature (play, pause etc)Can't reply to notificationsLow resolution displayI didn't buy this from Amazon India but from another Indian E-Commerce website. My first impressions were the light weight and superb quality of the screen glass which is 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It's a reflective screen which means it will save a lot of battery and the visibility of the screen will be crystal clear and bright in broad daylight. In the dark you can certainly press the side button for the led back light.The strap is soft and of good quality. Both the sides are locked with pins and the strap can be easily replaced.Pair the watch with MI Fit app for Android/iOS for the complete tracking of your heart rate, workouts, sleep, steps etc. Watch faces can easily be changed from the MI Fit app, and for more watch faces one can download mywatchfaces from the app store. All the watch settings can be changed from the MI Fit app.Notifications like Facebook, Whatsapp, Calls, Email, SMS etc can be turned on and will be displayed on the watch screen, you can just read them and not reply. Incoming calls can be put to silent by hitting ignore and can be disconnected by hitting hang up. You can't answer them.I just wish they had the feature for music where you could change the tracks, play and pause the music. But all in all a great budget smart watch with superb battery life. Its been 7 days since I last full charged it. It's at 81% now with notifications of majority of the apps are on and even the heart rate monitor is set at 1 min intervals which also monitors the resting heart rate. If you want more juice out of the battery you can change these settings.",137 people found this helpful,R2YVFCBXX669JI,,Amazfit-Huami-Screen-Smartwatch-A1608,B078YRTS86,5.0,B078YRTS86,137

If you are in Apple Ecosystem this is must have. Sound quality is phenomenal as wired headphones and build quality is just ultimate. If you have a budget buy them without thinking twice! I don't see any cons besides I have to tell Siri to adjust volume. Before buying I was bit skeptical about how useful it will be for me but it's completely worth every penny I've paid. Thanks to Amazon for giving generous discount while in stores it's at fixed prices and many of Apple stores have no stock of these. It's also rare to spot these little gadget so it attracts peoples attention when you wear in public. It's really premium quality product from Apple and quality do not comes cheap.

To ensure that I do not have to worry about charging each one of them separately, I had to look out for something that can charge multiple devices at once.That's why I got the Trajectory 3 in 1 Wireless Charging Cable.The length of the cable is 1 M, which I think is more than enough. The small size also means that I can carry it around without worrying about space constraints.Thinks that I liked- Multiple charging ports- It comes with wireless charging for Apple Series 1/2/3 watches. It is magnetic in nature- Good quality cable built using thick copper cable- Standard size- Works nicely when charging three devices at once.The charger also has proper protection mechanisms, including over-voltage protection, over current protection, and temperature protection.Things that I think can be improved- Pricing can be better- A carry case would have been a great addition to itIf you liked my review, then do click the helpful button.

There’s just one hole on the cover while there are two on the series 2 and 3. Basically, this is for the first gen and series 1 apple watch. If you can handle the hole, it’s a perfect buy, else it’s not perfect atleast design wose ;) And the nightstand! I just love it. It’s got some weight to it which makes it feel high quality, and it’s got 3M tape below to stick to surfaces. Also comes in a sweet white box.

The touch has no issues and the look is great and it offers complete protection. All the other watch covers only offer protection on the sides but this one protects the front face too.

You can tap on your ipad , but it does not shake.+ Packaging of the product (not of Amazon) is of international standards.Dislike- Unreasonable Price. I got it for 599 /- . IMHO , it should be not more than 300-350 /-- Does not work on uneven surfaces like bed, simply topples. My tip here is , use a hard flat surface like cardboard or box on bed and then use it.- The slanting adjustments are of 3-4 fixations. In other words, you cannot vary the slant as per your wish.- I wish the supporting leg(the one that stays in the back and gives the needed support) of the stand could have been longer.That is because for shorter inclinations , the stand becomes unstable for IPads/mobiles.

538,5.0 out of 5 stars,This stand rocks! Perfect for travel and home/office use.,2018-06-17,Verified Purchase,"This a must have accessory if you have a tablet, especially sizable ones like say the iPad. The weight and the design of this make it versatile and stable.The design is minimalist and clever. A button at bottom of the folding edge of the stand is used to change the angle of the stand and can be used to fold or lock it away for storage. It might weigh a couple of hundred grams but it can be used anywhere. Especially, on a non-rigid surface like a bed/mattress/couch, should you need to set it up on there, it will still remain stable. This makes it versatile.The powder coated metal body is elegant left to itself. And will blend in with your table top like a contemporary showpiece.Could be better: The moulded rubber piece on which the tab rests is not secured. It keeps falling off. I don't want to spoil the look by taping it down.

While the stand is well designed and sturdy, it’s not designed to house large tablets. Anything upto 7-8 inch max would fit properly but if you plan to stick your ipad 9.7 or 10.5 into this, then please rethink your options. The stand wobbles unless you extend it by atleast 45 degrees and even then it’s not too stable. There’s always a risk of toppling over.I managed to fix the problem by using layers of double sided tape to create a makeshift base for the stand. That’s why I’m giving 3 stars.

Thus ensuring the safety of your phone and the battery.  (JFYI, the charging light turns off when this happens)The thing about fast wireless chargers using the Qi technology is that they won't be as fast as a wired charger, however convenience is the most important factor when going wireless imho.

629,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive Charging Cable For Apple Devices!,2019-12-02,Verified Purchase,"As a tech person, I am invested in the Apple ecosystem. To ensure that I do not have to worry about charging each one of them separately, I had to look out for something that can charge multiple devices at once.That's why I got the Trajectory 3 in 1 Wireless Charging Cable.The length of the cable is 1 M, which I think is more than enough. The small size also means that I can carry it around without worrying about space constraints.Thinks that I liked- Multiple charging ports- It comes with wireless charging for Apple Series 1/2/3 watches. It is magnetic in nature- Good quality cable built using thick copper cable- Standard size- Works nicely when charging three devices at once.The charger also has proper protection mechanisms, including over-voltage protection, over current protection, and temperature protection.Things that I think can be improved- Pricing can be better- A carry case would have been a great addition to itIf you liked my review, then do click the helpful button.

663,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Smartwatch for this price range,2019-10-24,Verified Purchase,"When the word ""Smart Watch"" comes in mind, we all have a very rigid idea about it that It will be super costly as there are few brand which we show confidence on. Brand like Apple, Samsung etc.But what if I tell you that you can have the luxury of a Smart Watch at a very affordable price with ""ISABELLA Unisex Bluetooth 4g Smart Watch"".A price which anyone can afford.I personally wanted  to have a Smart watch from so long although like you all I also had the money issue.And with big brands, this wish of having a smart watch was far away from my reach but I played a gamble of buying a Smart watch from an Unknown brand which actually paid off really well.This smart watch from ISABELLA is too good and believe me I am not bragging here, this watch can even fight with higher end devices.Let me first tell you about the pros and cons (which is negligible in this price range)PROS:-* Feels very comfortable in hand* Looks premium* Touch works amazingly smooth* Working is very simple, not at all complex* Battery life is amazing, easily went 2-3 for a full charge* Charging speed is pretty quick, full charge in less than an hour* Very easily connects with your Smartphone via Bluetooth* You can even use it a separate phone as it comes with a sim slot and memory card slot* Supports 4g* Pre -Installed Pedometer works great* Have 3 different variation of clock skin which suits the watch pretty well* Product is very light in weight which makes it very easy to carry.CONS:-* Smart watch contains a VGA camera* Only comes in  black colorAccessories inside the box:-* USB charging cable* User manualMy prediction/conclusion regarding this watch ""ISABELLA Unisex Bluetooth 4g Smart Watch "":-An amazing device for this price range, easily can be compared with some higher end devices.Go for this Smart Watch without any worry as it really worth the money.",7 people found this helpful,R36RX0QWDP6ME5,,ISABELLA-Bluetooth-Support-Compatible-Android,B07YNP1M4T,5.0,B07YNP1M4T,7
664,2.0 out of 5 stars,For Basic Communication It is OK.,2019-10-31,Verified Purchase,"This watch I bought for my 12 year old daughter on safety measure.Purpose is, very basic communication and at the same time to avoid smartphone features like YouTube etc,.Like: Class over. Come and pickup me.  etc.,Importantly when I stuck in Traffic/in Rain, I can inform her that I am coming late to pick up :) .  So that she will not come and wait on Road.Pros:Watch Strap/Belt is strong and good.Watch Built material is good.Screen touch sensitivity is good.SIM based calls working fine. (Checked with only VODAFONE SIM)Screen is concealed in all round, so that Kids cannot easily break it. [Her previous watch screen got hit on edge and broken while she was playing with it and lost the touch sensitivity]For Kids, it is easy to wear than maintaining a special phone with them in hand/bag.It has vibration mode in profiles. [Useful for KID in any class rooms]Cons:USB Type-B cable.  But its charging pin is (must be) long (Yes, supplied along with product).  So you cannot use already available general phone chargers.  Because phone charger standard pins are not longer.  You must use only the provided cable, otherwise, your phone charger pin will not reach the charging slot perfectly.Letters/font is bit smaller.  Difficult to read.Battery backup is So so.. [ My previously ordered battery was worst.  It was swollen in 2 days.  So I am bit ok with this low battery backup :) ]Difficult to press the Options in bottom of screens. [Big fingers will have problem]Calendar/Date settings selection, I faced problem in selecting the correct date.Note:  Generally these kind of watches MIC and Speakers are low in Sensitivity and Volume.Mic looks to be left side when you put in front of you. [When you wear to left hand, mic would come to your left.  So you have to stretch hand bit more while talking.]Speaker looks to be in the bottom of watch dial.  Which will touch to your hand.  So voice looks to be blocked a little.[But my kid is able to listen and manage to communicate even on Road.  Old watch also same]Generally these kind of watches in this price range should be used “SIMILAR TO” walky-talky.  Because you need to put your mouth & ear near to watch to talk & listen.  Both talk & listening is bit difficult to do at a time on Road/Noisy area.Still not checked the BT, SD card.[03-Nov-2019]Battery is draining very quickly.[05-Dec-2019]This watch is not worth for this cost.Few Menu Options are bit difficult to select.Battery draining faster :(So kid is not much interested now to wear after all these difficulties.Overall not having great experience with this.",8 people found this helpful,R1XOH8ALZX9G97,,ISABELLA-Bluetooth-Support-Compatible-Android,B07YNP1M4T,2.0,B07YNP1M4T,8

667,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smart watch,2019-10-25,Verified Purchase,So got this beautiful watch on the first day it was launched at the Amazon Prime Day sale.Coming to the watch its marvelous. The display and the watchface are great.! The thing about this display is more the sunlight the more good the display would be. So there is no problem to view in bright sunlight as those of amoled watches.My first installation took about more than 20 minutes with the watch upgrading and optimizing itself.The ui is a bit choppy as compared to Samsung and huawei watches but still you can expect a fluid ui at this pricepoint.You can view whatsapp notifications or mail notifications but sadly cant reply to them.The best usp of this watch are the watchfaces. This watch is a darling of developers. It has more than 5000 free watchfaces which you can swipe around. Just by installing an another app.The battery life have not checked it drained 10 percent on day one so may go around 15 days. Ps. I had the lift to wake up and hrm on all the time. So if you turn of them you would get more battery life.My biggest surprise came when I found out that this watch had Compass and pressure sensors. Although i may not use it more often still is a nifty feature to have.Overall the best smartband,2 people found this helpful,R371G89FE37BX5,,ISABELLA-Bluetooth-Support-Compatible-Android,B07YNP1M4T,5.0,B07YNP1M4T,2

669,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonder watch,2019-11-08,Verified Purchase,"So I got watch few days ago, I thought because its too cheap, I shouldn't expect much features from it. But this product proved me wrong. I can't tell you how happy I am after using this product. So let me explain you all the features -1. You can Make calls, receive calls and send messages,receive messages etc etc....all basic functions of your phone in it, so no need to keep your phone in hand , just put it in your pocket and do all things through your watch.2. Wanna listen music, don't worry , this watch has that feature too, just connect your phone with your watch through Bluetooth and enjoy the music, speaker quality of watch is good, you can listen music on high volume too.3. All smart watch features related to health are present in it, pedometer, sleep monitor,sedentary are just awesome.4.Amazing Battery life, Charge once and use it for 4-5 days. I don't think you will get this kind of battery life in any other smart watch.5. You can get notification of your social media in it, and all other basic feature of phone like alarm, contacts, file manager are in it. Best part is it has camera too, so you can click photos also , and can also make video calls.So all feature of phone in your hand and at this price are really appreciable.

670,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you definitely want a affordable Milanese Band...look no further,2019-07-05,Verified Purchase,"I have a comparison at hand. Well, I mean to say, Apple watches that my family members own, we do have one Milanese band which is bought from Apple store at a staggering price.We have nylon conventional band, rubber conventional band and the poor cousin of metal Milanese, the Velcro nylon band too.So, now that you know the comparison I spoke about, I ordered this band for the price which is about 7% of the original band you buy from Apple store. So, I wasn’t expecting anything great.But, voila, this band turns out to be an eyebrow raiser. Partly because I had extremely low expectation from it, and largely because it’s indeed very well built. The look and feel is similar if not same as the original one. I can’t comment on the inner quality as well as few other things like longevity and comparable wear and tear at this moment. But even if this band lasts for 1/5th time of an original Apple Milanese band, it’s worth every penny.It fits nicely to the watch and the magnetic holder is indeed strong. It’s very gentle on the skin and looks top class from exterior.I would recommend this for sure. Even to those who are “Original Only” buyers.Barring the unknown fact of its longevity and colour guaranty which can be known only over a time, this is an excellent buy.",9 people found this helpful,RJHR4VDERUBK4,,Affairs-Stainless-Milanese-Magnetic-Compatible,B07M7WPQB6,5.0,B07M7WPQB6,9

The charging mat does what is advertised. Just place the phone on it and it will start charging. It lights up in blue from both sides when its powered on. and once it recognises the device is incompatible it turns red. a great feature to know if the device doesn't support it or isn't charging from the pad. Has some weight to it which makes it look sturdy and long lasting and the cloth mat goes great with my google home mini as it had the same colour and compliments my desk.

728,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,2019-02-17,Verified Purchase,I have used 3 different types of covers for my previous apple watches and this was the second one for my Apple Watch series 4.This is the most value for money case for an Apple Watch. The colour and everything looks great... though I might add it’s a little too shiny... but the case is very good. And it even covers the watch face. The touch has no issues and the look is great and it offers complete protection. All the other watch covers only offer protection on the sides but this one protects the front face too. I will come back and give the review for durability as I just started using it today... but so far everything is great !,23 people found this helpful,R25Z8AI82PHYBI,,TASLAR-Anti-Scratch-Lightweight-Protective-Compatible,B07LBS53CQ,5.0,B07LBS53CQ,23

774,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple, compact, reliable. (Read full review)",2019-01-26,Verified Purchase," I recently lost my Mevofit Drive fitness tracker and was on the lookout for a suitable replacement. I think I found it!Pros:- Small and light weight.- Easy to charge via USB port.- Straps are easy to remove and reattach.- Responds quickly to your touches and taps.Cons:- Lacks a heart rate sensor.- When charging, you need to hold on to the extra strap. It should've been stuck to the other one from under the device body. (Watch the video)Overall, for the asking price, the biggest competitor this device has is the Xiaomi Mi band 3. But I would personally go for this over the Mi band 3 simply because it does not require a separate charger and can be stuck to any device which has a USB type-A port.If you are looking for a reliable, lightweight fitness tracker, and you don't mind losing a heart rate sensor, you can absolutely go for the YG3 fitness band.Please press the ""helpful"" button if you found this review useful.",20 people found this helpful,R3T5RXRJ22ZYKR,,HolyHigh-Fitness-Waterproof-Messages-Reminder,B07HCBMLT7,5.0,B07HCBMLT7,20

For pairing, look the video in product page in product page.2. In case, if you loose either of the ear pods, it becomes a mono pod as I don't think seller will provide a single pod.3. Lot of disconnections. Connection is not constant despite being fully charged and being in range.4. Either of the pods keep disconnecting on it's own sweet will.5. No marking on either of pods. It's a wild guess which is master pod and which is other.6. Mic not upto the mark. Need to talk or rather shout loudly.7. Can't play games or videos as there is always lag of at least 2 seconds in picture and sound.Cons weigh more than pros.Buy only if deal gives you these pods under 1500.

But when I saw this great price tracker, I decided to try it.  I wear it every time when I do exercises. It works quite well, and help me to keep a more proper way in exercise s. It’s easy to be charged and the battery can last quite long time, about three to five days. I can see the date and time on it. It shows the step count on the screen. The app functions well. But I found the screen is not sensitive enough when I touch it. I tried many times when I used it the first time, then I found the sensitive part of the screen.and very happy to cam operation with this bandOverall, there’s no problem with my device for now.

876,3.0 out of 5 stars,Check details before you buy,2019-07-29,Verified Purchase,"Pros : Four devices can be charged simultaneously. Blue light indicates charging. It comes with 3 charging cables. One for Android, one for iPad and another for old model phones with bigger charging ports. You can use the original usb chargers itself for charging your devices.Cons : Made in China. The blue indicator light is always on even when the device is fully charged. So, you have to manually check. There are only two 2.4A ports. The other two are 1A. So, you can only use two ports to charge iPad, android phone or kindle device.As this is Chinese product, durability is a big question mark. So, i will update after a month. But, i think (for now) it is worth the money.UPDATE : THE CHARGER WORKS FINE. BUT, WHEN I TRIED USING MY ORIGINAL CHARGER (iPAD, ANDROID MOBILES), I GOT NOTIFICATION IN THE DEVICE THAT, ""THIS USB IS NOT COMPATIABLE"". SO, DO NOT USE THE CABLES PROVIDED BY SOOPI.

Very disappointed.",244 people found this helpful,R3FY7W46EREVDZ,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,1.0,B01N6OLO8U,244
889,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely useless product,2018-11-01,Verified Purchase,"I have a Oneplus 5 smartphone and my work involves a lot of meetings. It was annoying to carry around my smartphone to be reminded of the meetings and that was my primary motivation to buy Gear S3, besides the other features it provided.When I researched about Gear S3, I found that it could connect to wifi independently and hence will not be dependent on the mobile phone. Alas! That was only for the models sold outside India. The India models can access data only via the smartphone bluetooth which means your mobility was restricted to 100 meters of your phone. That kind of sums up my entire frustration with the watch. This watch is smart only in the presence of a bluetooth enabled smartphone, else it's dumber than the imbeciles of Namaste England.In theory the watch claims to be doing a lot of things, from tracking your movements to notifying you of updates, to innumerable watch faces - but honestly all of them fall flat without the presence of your smartphone around.Add to it, the absolutely horrible and abhorrent documentation of Samsung or their community centers. The community centers are just echoes of wails from similarly frustrated customers who are unable to figure out what makes this costly hardware a smartwatch.Honestly, purchasing this would be an absolute waste of a money. Better buy a Fitbit or some other fitness band",116 people found this helpful,RWL411CHFF5EQ,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,1.0,B01N6OLO8U,116
890,4.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely top notch with some accuracy issues,2019-07-28,Verified Purchase,"I was looking to buy a smartwatch since last 2 years and went through a lot of research and youtube videos to finally purchase Samsung Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch. The below review is based on 10 days of extensive usage of the watch. I have divided this review into pros and cons so let's see them one by one. We will start with the Pros firstPROS1- Gear S3 frontier is probably the best-looking smartwatch in the market which gets tough competition from Fossil Q Marshall. The rugged metallic look and finish gives it an amazing look and is a treat for your wrist.2- The big 46 mm dial gives a clear vision of time and small detailings like heart rate, calories burnt, steps walked, etc in just a single dial.3- There is absolutely no lag in the watch. The responses are absolutely quick and the touch is very good.4- All thanks to the Tizen OS, there are hundreds of paid and free watch faces available in the galaxy store which gives a new look to your watch every day.5- The calling feature is the best feature and is very useful if you are riding a bike or running or jogging. You don't have to take out your phone every time to see who is calling. The speaker is sufficiently louder and you can easily take calls on your watch without any problems.6- Push notifications are absolutely accurate and give you a lot of options to choose from the apps installed on your phone. You can read and reply to WhatsApp messages, FB messenger and SMSs as well. Typing on the watch is quite difficult due to the obvious small screens.7- I don't use a Samsung phone and there are no connectivity issues with the watch whatsoever.8- The rotating bezel does the job exceptionally well and from now on, I can't imagine my next smartwatch without a rotating bezel.CONS1- I am pretty much disappointed with the accuracy of the watch. While the heart rates and calories are measured with sufficient accuracy, steps count is not accurate as it counts steps even when I ride a bike or drive a car.2- I very much miss the availability of Samsung Pay (NFC) in the watch as it is not available in Indian models. Hope Samsung brings it soon to India.3- Being a sportsman, I really miss the sports modes in the watch. There is no Badminton mode or Tennis mode in the watch which is present even in the cheaper fitness bands available in the market.4- I wish Samsung provided an extra metal strap with the watch as the watch looks stunning with a metal band which i had to purchase separately.5- The battery lasts for 2-3 days if you keep the watch switched off when not in use or else even lesser. It takes good 4-5 hours for the watch to get fully charged from 0-100% which is very long.6- While riding a bike, the Cycling mode gets automatically started which shows the lack of accuracy.If you are looking for a great smartwatch with many features, this is surely the one you must go with as Galaxy Watch is very costly as compared to Gear S3 with only a few additional features. I got this watch at 15,990 on Prime day and i am super happy with it. If you find this review useful, just mark it HELPFUL so that others may read and get the information too.",78 people found this helpful,RIOIT65FPK50S,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,4.0,B01N6OLO8U,78
891,3.0 out of 5 stars,Zero for water resistance and customer support!,2019-03-16,Verified Purchase,"Hello,I brought Samsung smart watch in January 2019(3 months back). Now I have an issue that the device is continuously rebooting. I took it to the service center and they found water presence inside the watch and said that it wont be covered under warranty. Also the total amount for repair is around 16K which is 80% of watch cost.I wore my watch in rain. It comes to me as a surprise that a watch which claims to be a sports watch that can be used in 1 m deep water for 30 min is showing problems in mild rain!! I would also like to know if Samsung is cheating its customers by showing wrong specifications. I searched for reviews for the watch and found that many of your customers had the same issue. None of them are acknowledged by your team.Giving reviews for the product is the least thing that I can do at the moment since Samsung is unable to help me out for this issue, so that the other customers are not mislead.I am planning to compliant in consumer court for the same. Could you please help me out on how I can escalate this matter, so that Samsung can improve their product?For a reputed company like Samsung, it is totally unacceptable to release a product without giving accurate specifications.",61 people found this helpful,R3FDVMZE571QIM,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,3.0,B01N6OLO8U,61
892,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good to have if you have extra money !!!,2019-02-11,Verified Purchase,"To be brief, I find it useless. But read on to find out why. I bought it because it looks incredible, physically. However: - When in standby mode, the screen degrades the quality and the faces look low res. - When used with iPhone, there are no good watch faces at all. Seriously.The only good watch face is one that comes stock that has 2 circles on the sides, one with the weather and one with sunrise/sunset time. I want a watch that does the following: Looks amazing and manly, shows the time at all times, shows the weather, shows steps, shows calories burned, displays notifications and the rest is optional. - It has an always on display but it only lasts 1 day with it on. - It now has a continuous heart rate, but if you have this feature on, it will die before you go to bed. - It has GPS tracking but it will die in less than a day with it on - It has sleep tracking but there will be no battery left to track your sleep, so you'll likely charge it at night. - It has no map app, no GPS directions, you can't use it to guide you around. - The cool spinning gear, gets rotated due to rubbing on clothes and that triggers the watch to wake up, distracting you and other people, wasting extra battery, etc.I emailed Samsung about it and they included an option to disable the gear from waking up the watch in the latest software. One feature that it does great is take phone calls from your wrist.The speaker is loud and clear, but who makes phone calls anymore? So I have used this feature less than 5 times in 1 year. Another feature that's great is being able to play music right off the watch on it's built in speaker. I love this ability but there don't seem many opportunities to use it as I'd rather use headphones on the go and a bluetooth speaker at home. And finally, it's just too big!A standard men watch is 42mm, this is 46mm and it's quite high too due to it's rotating bezel. While I've gotten used to it's size, my clothes haven't. Dress shirts will feel tight around your wrist with the watch on and your wrist will hurt when you wear a winter jacket that's tight around the wrists to keep you warm. Nowadays, it just sits in it's charger and I don't have much opportunity to use it.",47 people found this helpful,RGSBJMKKMLSDC,,SAMSUNG-Gear-S3-Frontier-Smartwatch,B01N6OLO8U,3.0,B01N6OLO8U,47

The price sucks but I guess people like me who are obsessed with this design have to settle for this as far as 6s is concerned.
